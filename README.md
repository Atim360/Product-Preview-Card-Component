## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

That's was a very small project but for a beginner like me, I've find some aspects of the Frontend Development which can be really difficult, by that I principaly mean the aspect of the responsive design. According to me, code a card whom is fully responsive was the only difficulty of this project.

I don't have learned a lot of concrete things due to the simplicity of the project but it allowed me to practice some importants concepts and espicially Flexbox here.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for search and get more details on a lot of utils proprities I've used like min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height and more..
